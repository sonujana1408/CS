## BASIC

#### IDENTIFIER

* An identifier is a name having a few letters, numbers and special characters \_ (underscore).
* It should always satrt with non-nummaric character.
* It is used to identify a variable, function, symbolic constant ,class etc.
* Python is case sensitive pogramming language.

#### Constants

A constant is an identifier whose value cannot be changed throughout the execution of a program whereas the value keeps on changing.

* There is no constants in Python, the way they exist in C and Java.
* In Python, it is not possible to define constant whose value can not be changed.

In Python, Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words but remember its value can be changed.

### Variable

In C ,Java or some oyher programming languages, a variable is an identifier or a name , connected to memory location.

in python , variable is considered as tag that is tried to some value. Python considers value as objects.

**Camel Case `myVariableName`**

**Pascal Case **<mark style="color:red;">**`MyVariableName`**</mark>

**Snake Case `my_variable_name`**

**Many Values to Multiple Variables assign**

`x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry‚Äù`

**One Value to Multiple Variables Assign**

`x = y = z = "Orange‚Äù`

**Unpack a Collection Assign**

`fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`

`x, y, z = fruits`

To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the `global` keyword.

```python
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

```python
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

### DATA TYPE

Datatype represent the type of data stored into a variable or memory.

* Primitive Data types.
  *

      1. strings

      `my_string=‚Äùlouis‚Äù`

      `print(f"hello {my_string}")`
  *

      2. integer

      `my_int=42`
  *

      3. Float

      `my_float=13.35`
  *

      4. Boolean

      `my_bool=True`
* **Type of Data type**
  * Build-in Data type
  * User Define Data type

#### Build in Data Type

üè¶ \*\*Built-in Data Types\*\*

| Text Type:      | str                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Numeric Types:  | int, float, complex          |
| Sequence Types: | list, tuple, range           |
| Mapping Type:   | dict                         |
| Set Types:      | set, frozenset               |

|                 |                              |

#### User Define Data type

```
- Array
- Class
- Module

```

#### None Type

None datatype represents an object that doesn't contain any value.

#### **Numeric Type**

Following are the Numberic Data Type:-

1.  **Int:-** The int datatype represents an integer number. An integer number without any decimal point or fraction part. In Python, It is possible to store very large integer number as there is no limit for the size of an int datatype.

    `x = 1 # int`
2.  **Float :-** The float data type represents floating point numbers. A floating number is a number that contains a decimal point.

    `y = 2.8 # float`
3.  **Complex :-** A complex number is a number that is written in the from of

    **a+bj**

    * a = real part of the number
    * b = Imaginary part of the number
    *   j =Square root value of -1

        `z = 1j # complex`

#### **Strings**

String represents group of characters. String are enclosed in double quotes or single quotes.

`name:str="hrttr" print("my name is {name}")`

**Multiline srting**

```python
customer:str = "pintu"
pizza_base:str = "Thin"
pizza_size:int=12
topping:str = "Olivers"
eatra_cheese:bool=True
price:int =450
order_details:str=f"""
Recived order from:{custumer}
Pizza Base: {pizza_base}
is extra cheese required:{extra_cheese}
bill amount(price}
"""
print(order_details)
```

üè¶ \*\*Slicing\*\*

`b = "Hello, World!"`

`print(b[2:5])` # llo

`print(b[:5])` #Hello

`print(b[2:])` #lo, World!

`print(b[-5:-2])` # orl

#### **Boolean Type**

The boolean datatype represents boolen value True of False. Python internally represents True as 1 and False as 0.

#### SEQUENCE TYPE

#### 1. **List :-**

A list represent a group of elements. A list can store different types of elements which can be modified. List are dinamic which means size is not fixed. List are represented using square bracket\[].

#### 2. **Tuple:-**

A tuple contains a group of elements which can be different types. it is similiar to **LIST** but Tuples are read-only which means we can not modify it's element. Tuples are represented using parentheses () .

#### 3. **Range**

range represents a sequence of numbers. The numbers in the range are not modifiable.

*   `example=> rg=range(5) //0 1 2 3 4`

    ```
       rg =range(10,20,2)  //10,12,14,16,18
    ```

1. **SET TYPE**

* A set an unordered collection of elements much like a set in mathematics.
* The order of elements is not maintained in the sets. It means the elements may not appear in the same order as they are entered into the set.
* A set does not accept duplicate elements.
* Sets are unordered so we can not access its element using index.
* Sets are represented using curly brackets {}.

1.  **Mapping Type /dict/ Dictionary** A map represents a group of elements in the from of key value pairs. Mapping are represented using **key:value** pairs

    `data={'ram':25,'sumon':28}`

#### **Casting**

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

```python
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0  
```

#### Membership Operators

The membership operators are useful to test for membership in a sequence such as string, list,truples and dictionaries.

There are two type of membership operator:-

* in
* not in

**1. in:-** This operators is used to find an element in the specified sequence.

it returns True if element is found in the specified sequence else it return False.

**2. not in** This operators works in reverse manner for in operator.

it returns True if element is not found in the specified sequence and if element is found, then it returns False.

#### **Identity Operators**

The identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects. Hence, it is possible to know whether two objects are same or not.

There are two type of identity operators---

**1. is**

* This is used to compare whwther two objects are same or not.
* it returns True if memory location of two objects are same else it return False. **2. is not** This operator works in reverse manner for is operator.

it return True if memory location of two objects are same and if they are same it returns False.

#### _**Output Statements**_

**print() Function** The print() function is used to print the specified message to the output screen/device. The message can be a string, or any other object.

#### _**input Statement**_

**input()** This function is used to accept input from keyboard.

This function will stop the program flow until the user gives an input and end the input with the return key.

prompt is a string or massage, representing a default message before input.(it is optional)

***

#### **Indentation**

Indentation refer to space that are used in the beginning of a statement. By default python puts a spaces but it can be change by programmers.

#### **Random Number**

Python does not have a `random()` function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called `random` that can be used to make random numbers:

```python
import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))
```

#### **IfSatatement/turntogg**

    Statement_1
elif(condition_2):
    Statement_2
elif(condition_3):
    statement_3
....
elif(condition_n):
    statement_n
Rest of code

```

***

#### **while loop**

```
while(condition):
        Satement
        rest of the code

```

#### **while else Loop**

```
while(condition):
        statement_1
else:
        statement_2
Rest code

```

#### **Infinite while loop**

```
while(true):
        statement
        if(condition):
        break
Rest of the code

```

#### **Nested while loop**

```
while(condition):
        statements
        while(condition):
                statements
else:
        statement

```

#### **for loop**

```
for var in sequence:
        statements
Rest of the code

```

***

#### **range() Function**

**range()** range() is used to generate a sequence of integers starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 by default. till j-1.

```

range(start,stop,stepsize)
#start:- starting position. If we do not mention start by default it's 0.
#stop :- ending position. the range of integers stops one element prior to stop. if stop is j then it will  stop at exact j-1
# Stapesize:- Increment by stepsize. if we do not mention start by default it is 1.

```

***

#### **Break Statement**

Break statement is used to jump out of loop to process the next statement in the program.

```
while(condition):
    if(condition):
         break

```

#### **Continue Statement**

Continue statement is used in a loop to go back to the beginning of the loop.

```
while (condition):
    if(condition):
        continue
Rest of code

```

#### **Pass Statement/turnh3**

Pass statement is used to do nothing. it can be used inside a loop or if statement to represent no operation. Pass is useful when we need statement syntactically correct but we do not want to do any operation.

```
if (condition):
    pass
else:
    satements

```

## **Array**

In python, Array is an object that provide a mechanism for storing several data items with only one identifier,thereby simplifying the task of data management. Array is beneficial if you need to store group of elements of same data type.

* Array can store only one type of data.
* In Python , the size of array is not fixed. Array can increase or decrease their size dynamically.
* Array and List are not same.
* Array uses less memory than List.

#### **Type of Array**

*   One Dimention Array / One D Array - Single Row Multiple columns

    ```
    [101,102,103,104,105]

    ```
*   Multi-Dimentional Array / Multi D Array - Multiple Rows Multiple columns

    ```
     [40,60,75,45,56],
     [52,45,58,71,55]

    ```

> Note- Python does not support Multi-Dimentional Array but we can create Multi Dimentional Array using third party packages like numpy

#### **Import Array Module**

Two way to import array module:-

* import array - This will import the entire module
* from array import \* -This will import all class, objects, variable etc from array module. Here \* means all.

#### **Creating and Initializing One-D Array**

```
import array
array_name=array.array("type_code",[elements])

```

```
from array import*
array_name=array('type code',[elements])

```

#### **Creating Empty One-D Array**

```
from array import *
stu_roll=array('i',[])

```

***

## function

#### **append()**

This method is used to add an element at the end of the existing array.

```
array_name.append(new_element)

```

#### **insert()**

This method is used to insert an element in a particular potion of the existing array.

```
array_name.insert(position_number,new_element)

```

#### **pop()**

This method is used to remove last element from the existing array.

```
array_name.pop()

```

#### **remove()**

This method is used to remove first occurrence of given element from the existing array. If it doesn't found the element,shows value Error.

```
array_name.remove(element)

```

#### **index()**

This method return position number of first occurrence of given element in the array. It it doesn't found element,shows valueError.

```
array_name.index(element)

```

#### **reverse()**

This method used to reverse the order of elements in the array.

```
array_name.reverse()
```

#### **extend()**

This method is used to append another array or iterable at the end of the array.

```
array_name.extend(arr)
```

#### Slicing on Array

Slicing on array can be used to retrieve a piece of the array that contains a group of elements. Slicing is useful to retrieve a range of element.

new\_array2=new\_array1\[start : stop : stepsize]
